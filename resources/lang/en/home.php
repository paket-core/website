    'about_desc_1' => 'We believe in breaking up monopolies and giving power to the people. We believe technology can help the global community to organize and cooperate without central authorities.
We’re creating a network that will allow everyone to take part in a global package delivery network that has no central authority.',
    'about_desc_2' => 'Bitcoin revolutionized the payment industry by making it decentralized. PaKeT was born to answer a similar need - transferring goods without a central entity. We see this is an opportunity to solve a “real world” problem using the blockchain technology in its decentralized, purest form.  A genuine way to exchange physical value between people, without any central authority managing the process and taking a hefty commission.',

    'project_1_desc' => 'Because an efficient system is one that lets every part do what it does best, and everybody stands to win from a more efficient way of transporting goods. The PaKeT platform is open to everybody, doesn\'t take any commission, is fully transparent, and the organization does not raise funds by selling any equity or shares. The only way to support the system is by using the network and becoming a part of it, by buying, using, and earning BUL tokens.',
    'project_2_title' => 'Why we chose Stellar',
    'project_2_desc' => 'Because the Stellar platform, which connects payments systems and people, can move value quickly, reliably, securely, and at almost no cost. It is a perfect match for our need for a low friction transactional layer. We chose Stellar as our initial consensus layer for its level-headedness, its blazingly fast transaction rate, and its extremely low fees. From all the mature blockchain platforms currently active in the market, Stellar was the obvious decision for us. Read more about Stellar here.',

Real-time data communication and tracking, delivery insurance and advanced routing techniques are just a small part of what this platform has to offer.',
    'project_5_title' => 'Environmentally Friendly',
    'project_5_desc' => 'Optimizing delivery routes will significantly reduce the amount of energy spent and fossil fuels burned. Just by moving last mile deliveries from fleets of trucks to local couriers on bicycles, or even to people carrying packages on the way, as part of their daily routine, we can significantly reduce global carbon footprint.',
    'project_6_title' => 'P2P deliveries',
    'project_6_desc' => 'Millions of people worldwide are members of online marketplaces that allow the exchange of goods between participants. A key problem for these communities is transporting the goods between participants, and the lack of trust between strangers is a huge obstacle for real P2P trade. Small online retailers face similar challenges as they lack the means to compete with industry giants in terms of logistics. With the PaKeT platform, these problems can become a thing of the past.',
