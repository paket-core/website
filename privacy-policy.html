    <li><h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION TO MAKE AUTOMATED DECISIONS</h2>
        <p>We may use systems to make automated decisions based on information we hold about you. This helps us to make
            sure our decisions are quick, fair, efficient and correct, based on what we know. These automated decisions
            can affect the products, services or features we may offer you now or in the future. The following are some
            of the ways we may use systems to make automated decisions:</p>
        <p><em>Tailoring products and services</em></p>
        <p>We may use your data along with that of other customer in order to study and learn about our customers'
            needs, and to make decisions based on what we learn. This helps us to design products and services for
            different customer groups, and to manage our relationships with them.</p>
        <p><em>Fraud detection</em></p>
        <p>We use your personal information to help determine if your account is being used fraudulently or for
            money-laundering. If there is a risk of fraud, or money laundering, we may suspend or terminate your account
            and refuse access to your account.</p>
        <p><em>Opening accounts</em></p>
        <p>We may use automated checks to help determine if you satisfy our criteria for an account, including fraud,
            money laundering and eligibility checks.</p>
        <p><strong>Your rights with respect to automated decisions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>You can ask that we do not make our decision based on the automated decision alone.</p></li>
            <li><p>You can object to an automated decision, and ask that a person reviews it.</p></li>
            <li><p>If you want to know more about these rights, or to exercise them, please contact us.</p></li>

    </li>

        <p>Where data is to be transferred to a group company in a country outside of the EEA which may not offer the
            same level of protection as the GDPR with respect to the processing of your personal data, we will ensure
            that the group company agrees to binding corporate rules in accordance with Article 47 of the GDPR. Further
            information can by found on the EC's website: <a target="_blank"

        <p>Where we transfer data to organisations based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the
            Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe
            and the US. For further details, see EC's website page: <a target="_blank"

    <li><h2>DATA SECURITY</h2>
        <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally
            lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your
            personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to
            know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
            confidentiality.</p>
        <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
            applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p></li>
    <li><h2>KEEPING AND DELETING YOUR DATA</h2>
        <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for,
            including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
        <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
            sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
            personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
            purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
        <p>We keep certain data for minimum periods, namely:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>we retain Transaction Data for a minimum of six years after the date of the transaction;</p></li>
            <li><p>we retain certain Account Information, for a minimum of six years after your agreement with us has
                    ended.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The majority of personal data we hold will be deleted 10 years after the termination of any agreement you
            have with us unless it is needed for other necessary or legitimate purposes.</p>
        <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see request erasure below for further
            information.</p>
        <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you)
            for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further
            notice to you.</p></li>
    <li><h2>YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
        <p>Under the GDPR you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Request access to your personal data</strong> (commonly known as a "data subject access
                    request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check
                    that we are lawfully processing it.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.</strong> This enables you to
                    have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the
                    accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Request erasure of your personal data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to delete or
                    remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have
                    the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised
                    your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
                    unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note,
                    however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal
                    reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Object to processing of your personal data</strong> where we are relying on a legitimate
                    interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which
                    makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental
                    rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data
                    for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate
                    grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party</strong>. We will
                    provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
                    machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you
                    initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with
                    you.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your
                    personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
                    withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products
                    or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
                </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights you will need to contact us using the contact details above. In
            the case of exercising your right to access, you will also need to provide appropriate evidence of your
            identity.</p>
    <li><h2>NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</h2>
        <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
            However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
            Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p></li>
    <li><h2>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h2>
        <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right
            to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
            that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to
            ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p></li>
