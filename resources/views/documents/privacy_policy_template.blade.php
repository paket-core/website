                information, unless this Privacy Policy states otherwise. However, it is a common practice for most
                websites to collect certain data such as IP addresses and other user information, which is collected,
                analyzed and processed anonymously by specialized software, mostly but not only, to optimize user
                experience. In certain situations, we will ask for further personal information that we sometimes
                require to perform some of the services that we provide.
