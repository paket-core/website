    'about_desc_1_li_1' => 'We believe in breaking up monopolies and giving power to the people.',
    'about_desc_1_li_2' => 'We believe technology can organize the global community and lead to cooperation without any central authority.',
    'about_desc_1_li_3' => 'We created an open protocol through which everyone can take part in a fully decentralized and global package delivery network.',
    'about_desc_2' => 'Bitcoin revolutionized the payment industry by decentralizing it. PAKET answers a similar need - transferring goods in a decentralized manner. We see this as an opportunity to solve a real-world problem using the principals of blockchain technology in their purest form: a genuine way to exchange physical value between people, without any central authority managing the process and taking a hefty commission.',

    'project_1_desc' => 'Because an efficient system is one that lets every part do what it does best, and because everybody stands to win from a more efficient way of transporting goods. The PAKET platform is open to everybody, doesn\'t take any commission, and is fully transparent. The PAKET Project does not raise funds by selling equity or shares, and the only way to support the system is by using the network and becoming a part of it - buying, using, and earning BUL tokens.',
    'project_2_title' => 'Why we chose Stellar',
    'project_2_desc' => 'Because the Stellar platform, which connects payments systems, and people, can move value quickly, reliably, securely, and at almost no cost. It is a perfect match for our need for a low friction transactional layer. We chose Stellar as our initial consensus layer for its level-headedness, its blazingly fast transaction rate, and its extremely low fees. From all the mature distributed ledger platforms currently active in the market, Stellar was the obvious decision for us.

    'project_3_li_2' => '<strong>L2 (Route) – </strong>matches requirements of senders with capacity and cost of couriers, while providing a detailed and highly contextualized view into the supply and demand of the market.',
    'project_3_li_3' => '<strong>L3 (Application) – </strong>consolidates tools and applications that allow simple and intuitive participation in the network.',

    'project_5_desc' => 'Optimizing delivery routes will significantly reduce the amount of energy spent < and of fossil fuels burned. We can significantly reduce the global carbon footprint just by moving last mile deliveries from fleets of trucks to local couriers on bicycles, or even to people carrying packages on the way, as part of their daily routine.',
    'project_6_title' => 'P2P deliveries',
    'project_6_desc' => 'Millions of people worldwide are members of online marketplaces for the exchange of goods between participants. A key problem for these communities is transporting the goods, and the lack of trust between strangers is a huge obstacle for real P2P trade. Small online retailers face similar challenges as they lack the means to compete with industry giants in terms of logistics. With the PAKET platform, these problems become a thing of the past.',
    'project_7_title' => 'The Un-Commerced Majority',
    'project_7_desc' => 'Citizens of the first world often complain about the inefficiencies, limitations, and high cost of modern deliveries, but often forget that in most of the world reliable deliveries are not even an option. The PAKET ecosystem changes all that, providing global coverage wherever demand exists, solving a very real problem for a huge number of people, and finally providing a reliable trusted delivery service to an untapped market of staggering proportions.',

    'ecosystem_graph_desc_2' => 'Travelling from one city to another every morning? Weekly visits to the north? Even a one time trip: once the routes and requirements of every packages become fully visible, we are all opportunistic couriers that can earn BULs while keeping to our daily routine.',

    'ecosystem_graph_title_3' => 'Satellite service',
    'ecosystem_graph_desc_3' => 'An open delivery network is fertile ground for supporting services which can thrive within this new economy: insurance providers, courier co-ops, routing specialists, data scientists and analysers, and many more.',
