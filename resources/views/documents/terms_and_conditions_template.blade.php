    Preamble: block51 Project and ICO Information
    <ul class="preamble">
        <li>The Issuer is a company that is developing state-of-the-art cryptocurrency ATMs which the Issuer
            plans to produce and then operate in a number of countries.
        </li>
        <li>The Issuer plans to purchase and operate cryptocurrency mining hardware and operate this
            hardware in its mining facilities in the European Union.
        </li>
        <li>Furthermore, the Issuer will divide all operated hardware (both ATMs and mining hardware) into
            Fractional
            Ownership Units under its Fractional Ownership Program and then sell these Units on the Issuer´s
            website.
        </li>
        <li>Ownership Units are similar to Profit Sharing Agreements and entitle the Unit owner to
            participate in
            a share of the profits produced by the respective hardware.
        <li>In order to finance its operations, the Issuer is conducting an Initial Coin Offering (“ICO”)
            between
            March and June 2018.
        </li>
        <li>The TRIL Token sold during the ICO can be used to purchase Fractional Ownership Units or pay for
            Transaction Fees at the Issuer´s ATMs.
        </li>
        <li>These terms and conditions of the rights and obligations of the Issuer as well as of the
            Subscriber
            are laid down in these Terms, according to Swiss law. In any other jurisdiction, these Terms are
            meant to
            provide the Subscriber with relevant information regarding the ICO and in particular the risks,
            without
            claiming to be complete.
        </li>
        <li>These Terms relate to a cryptocurrency-related Initial Coin Offering and might therefore contain
            unexpected, surprising clauses simply due to the fact that there is no existing standard for
            Initial
            Coin Offerings yet.
        </li>
        <li>Please read these Terms carefully to ensure that you have understood and acknowledged any
            provisions
            contained in these Terms.
        </li>
        <li>The Issuer is a company limited by shares under Swiss law which has been registered in the
            commercial
        </li>
        <li>ister of the canton of Zurich (Switzerland) on May 30, 2008 under registration number
            CHE-114.326.916. The share capital amounts to CHF 250.000 and has been fully paid in.
        <li>Any purchase and sale of TRIL Tokens shall be on the terms and conditions set forth in these
            Terms.

            <ol>
                <li>The purchaser of TRIL Tokens (the <strong>“Subscriber”</strong>) hereby irrevocably
                    offers to

                <li>For Subscribers paying in cryptocurrencies, such as Ether, the amount of TRIL
                    Tokens purchased by
                    the
                    Subscriber is determined by the amount of cryptocurrencies he sends to the block51 ICO

                </li>
                <li>Subscribers paying in cryptocurrencies direct that, upon acceptance of their

                    the
                    Subscriber on the Issuer´s website. The Subscriber acknowledges that he needs to create

                    the
                    Issuer´s website, as stated in clause 5.1. of these Terms.

            <h3>TRIL TOKENS AND ICO</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The Issuer issues TRIL Tokens for a maximum aggregated principal amount (the
                    <strong>“Hardcap”</strong>) equivalent
                    to
                    30,000 Ether, a cryptocurrency. According to the total amount of subscriptions made
                    during the ICO
                    period
                    and depending on the relevant bonus schemes stated in the Issuer´s whitepaper, a certain
                    amount of TRIL
                    Tokens will be issued during the Issuer´s ICO.
                </li>
                <li>The Tokens are structured as simple crytocurrency payment (currency) tokens and do
                    not represent
                    equity
                    or any type of security of the Issuer´s capital.
                </li>
                <li>The Tokens can be subscribed at any time during the subscription period (the
                    <strong>“Subscription Period”</strong>)
                    which begins on April 25, 2018 at 12:00 GMT and shall end (i) on June 10, 2018 at 12:00
                    GMT, or (ii) at
                    the
                    point in time where the above mentioned Hardcap is reached. The Issuer has the right but
                    not the
                    obligation
                    to extend the Subscription Period, if he deems necessary. A shortening of the
                    Subscription Period is not
                    permitted. The Issuer can cancel the ICO at any time for legal reasons.
                </li>
                <li>The exact price and amount of bonus tokens for a Subscription at any particular
                    point in time is
                    described in the Issuer´s Whitepaper.
                </li>
                <li>Adding to the total amount of TRIL Tokens subscribed by Subscribers during the
                    Issuer´s ICO and
                    following the conclusion of the Subscription Period, a fixed amount of further TRIL
                    Tokens will be
                    issued
                    for compensation of management, founders, directors, advisors, and others. The exact
                    amount of further
                    TRIL
                    Tokens depends on the total amount of TRIL Tokens issued during the ICO and is stated in
                    the Whitepaper
                    which is publicly available on the Issuer´s website. Once these further TRIL Tokens are
                    released, no
                    more
                    TRIL Tokens will be created.
                </li>
                <li>TRIL Tokenholders shall have no shareholder rights, in particular, no rights to
                    participate, engage
                    in
                    or vote in the Issuer´s shareholder meeting or to subscribe to any securities to which
                    shareholders of
                    the
                    Issuer have subscription rights. The Tokens do not convey any right in a liquidation
                    surplus.

                <li>TRIL Tokens shall only be subscribed by and transferred to persons satisfying the
                    qualifications
                    described in these Terms and the legal requirements according to their respective laws.
                    The transfer of
                    TRIL
                    Tokens does not require the consent of the Issuer or any other Tokenholder. Technically,
                    the assignment
                    and
                    transfer of the TRIL Token shall be performed by way of transfer of the Token on the
                    Ethereum
                    blockchain.

                <li>These Terms and the power of attorney granted hereunder shall be binding upon the
                    parties hereto
                    and
                    upon their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and permitted
                    assings.
                </li>
                <li>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of

                <li>The presentation of the Issuer´s business model, Tokens and ICO, or the publication

                    Issuer and the
                    transfer of Ether by the Subscriber to the smart contract of the Issuer´s ICO. A token
                    Subscription is
                    also
                    legally effected by the Subscriber signing and filing the Subscription Agreement in

                    smart contract of
                    the
                    ICO, in the name of the Subscriber. The Subscribers waive the requirement of receipt of
                    an acceptance
                    declaration by the Issuer.

                    all other

                <li> Should any of the provisions in these Terms be or become invalid or unenforceable
                    in whole or in
                    part,
                    the validity or the enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be
                    affected or
                    impaired
                    thereby. In this case, the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a
                    provision which, to
                    the
                    extent legally possible, provides for an interpretation in keeping with the meaning and
                    the economic
                    purposes of these Terms at the time of the issue of the TRIL Tokens. Under circumstances

                    involved shall be
                    applied.

                    shall

                    period of two
                    weeks
                    from the point of time of notification of the Amendment Terms reaching the Subscriber by
