Anyone who holds BUL tokens can use them to pay for deliveries or commit them as collateral if she wants to deliver a package herself. Holding a BUL token also means holding a part of the entire PAKET economy. Staying true to creating a decentralized platform, we never gave any shares or equity in the project to anyone.
We need to decide what to do with that. With these applications, you can already use BULs to perform package transfer operations.",
